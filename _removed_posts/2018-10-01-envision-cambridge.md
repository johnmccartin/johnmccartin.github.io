# Envision Cambridge

Envision Cambridge is a three-year citywide planning process to set a course for the future of Cambridge, MA. Utile is the lead consultant on the public project, and my role at Utile has revolved around Envision since I started.

Here are some Envision Cambridge things:

- [Envision website](http://envision.cambridgema.gov)
- [*Cambridge Today*: an existing conditions report](http://envision.cambridgema.gov/cambride-today)
- [Engagement data viewer](http://envision.cambridgema.gov/engagement-data)
- Development projections and methodology (forthcoming)
