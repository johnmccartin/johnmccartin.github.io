# Minidocs

Minidocs is a super-simple rich text document editor that I built for myself to use. Google docs but if google docs was just Text Edit. Also it's pink.

Still very much in development. The back-end is essentially built, but I still need to add some basic UX features.

Tech: Node, Express, MongoDB, Pug, SCSS, jQuery
