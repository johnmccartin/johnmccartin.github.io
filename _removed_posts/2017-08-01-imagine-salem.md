# Imagine Salem

Imagine Salem was a citywide vision plan for Salem, MA. In this plan we ran data analyses on demographics, jobs, urban form, real estate, and mobility and presented those to stakeholder groups and the public at large. Together we then defined a vision and goals for the City that could guide future planning efforts. In 2018, the Salem Department of Community Development and the Salem Redevelopment Authority began taking steps to advance the goals of the plan.
